# Big Data
## Spark Practical Work

This project is my particular solution to the main project of the subject *Big Data*, taught at Technical University of Madrid during the fall of 2017.

The objective of this assignment was to create a model that was able to predict the delay of US flights.

The data used has been published by the US Department of Transportation, and it is available at this [location](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html).

In order to make the project work the user must place the data CSV file in `src/main/resources`, and rename the variable `inputFilePath` at the beginning of the `Main.scala` file.
